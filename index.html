                            I previously spent a lot of my time on vacation learning machine learning in python. I discovered many models, from Regression forests to Support-vector machines, and I learned how to apply them to large datasets. CMSC 150 is a direct introduction to machine learning, and I appreciated all the concepts it introduced to me last semester despite my disliking of "R" as a programming language. It was the most stimulating subject I've had so far.

                            Statistics was one of the subjects that I did not expect to enjoy. I was so used to statistics being a lot of computational logic to yield significant figures, but STAT 101 caught me off guard.  It was more on picking the right tools to maximize your methodology's effectiveness and truthfulness, which was just incredible. Everything they taught was useful for my future machine learning endeavors since those would need to have accompanying papers. Not to mention, the statistics faculty were the most prepared for online schooling. They managed to create high-quality learning materials that mimic expensive textbooks in such a small time frame.

                            Javascript is the most all-around language at the moment. I believe it to be the single language that any programmer should learn because of all its uses in the software industry. Javascript and recent additions to web technology allow it to develop cross-platform applications in desktop, mobile, and web. Plus, it has a large community and a good library base. Adapting javascript allows developers to think less of compatibility issues and spend more energy making relevant features to their revolutionary applications.
